scrapper
----------------------

For my needs (app), I've just wanted a simple tax database in json.
Looking around the web I didn't find a simple solution.
Most providers seems to be some overkill costly APIs.

This simple scrapper uses tax-rates.org which provides free access to tax rates, calculators and more to compile a simple json.

Note: This doesn't provide tax by zip-code.
