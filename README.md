Currency Utils
==============

This repo contains JSONs files I've found useful for calculations
related to currencies around the world.

Currently it has:
- [world_sales_tax.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talaviram/currency_utils/main/world_sales_tax.json) - global tax based on https://github.com/valeriansaliou/node-sales-tax but with finer US states taxes.
- [iso4217_currency_codes.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talaviram/currency_utils/main/iso4217_currency_codes.json) - mapping of alpha-2 country codes to their currency originated with latest [ISO4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).
- [latest_rates.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talaviram/currency_utils/main/latest_rates.json) - exchange rates cached from exchangerate.host. (If you use their rates, consider donating and using their service instead https://exchangerate.host/#/donate), I'm caching it here to simplify my needs.
