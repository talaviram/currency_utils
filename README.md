Currency Utils

This repo contains JSONs files I've found useful for calculations
related to currencies around the world.

Currently it has:
- [world_sales_tax.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talaviram/currency_utils/main/world_sales_tax.json) - global tax based on https://github.com/valeriansaliou/node-sales-tax but with finer US states taxes.

- [countries_iso3166_m49.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talaviram/currency_utils/main/countries_iso3166_m49.json) - countries with 3166-2 alpha2 key that contains alpha2 and alpha3 and UN-M49 with few languages from the [UN M49](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/)
- [top_currencies.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talaviram/currency_utils/main/top_currencies.json) - Most traded currencies ranked from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Most_traded_currencies)
